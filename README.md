# sql-challenge

This is my submission for Module 9 Challenge with Berkeley Data Analytics Boot Camp.

The SQL files can be found above in the folder EmployeeSQL in this repo.

There are 2 sub folders, one for EmployeeSQL and one for Data. EmployeeSQL contains the SQL files including the Schemata and Queries, Data contains all the data files needed. Running the schema.sql in PGadimin will create the tables and relationships needed. Running the queries.sql will pull the needed data from the tables.

There is also an ERD image and text file in there called ERD.PNG and schema.txt respectively.
